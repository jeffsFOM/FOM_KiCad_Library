# FOM_KiCad_Library
This is my private KiCad library of symbols and footprints used in my projects

These components have been "road tested" in projects I have done since starting
to use KiCad.  Note that although I use IPC standards for creating footprints that
compliance to any particular IPC standard is NOT guaranteed because they may have
had tweaks to sort various DFM issues at the board vendors I use.
