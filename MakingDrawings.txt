Notes on making fab and assembly drawings from KiCad.

Note that KiCad can only export DXF files one layer at a time.  So compositing
more than one layer to make a fabrication or assembly drawing can be a bit of
a challenge.  What I have done so far is:

1. Fab/Assy: Select the layers to view in the drawing.  Then use the PRINT
function rather than plotting to print out the file in SVG (scalable vector
graphic) rather than PDF.  Open the SVG file in the Gimp and trim as
necessary.  Depending on the size of the board, if small, import at 600dpi.
If large use 300dpi, or whatever. Crop the image and export as a .png image.

2. In AutoCAD on a drawing layer make sure imageframe is ON, then import as
raster graphics the top and bottom images of the board assemblies and fab
drawings.  Complete the rest of the drawing as usual.

3. For drill drawings KiCad exports those as DXF files so use that one for
creating drawings with dimensions.  NPT and PTH drawings are all created
separately so have to be composited in AutoCAD to complete the drill drawing.
